## `process.ts`
Can be ran with `node process.js`. Requires there to be a `translations.json` in the same folder, which you can find in the dumps result after using [SkeldJS' Dumpostor Fork](https://github.com/SkeldJS/Dumpostor).

Outputs a `translations.ts` which can be used to replace the one already in `src/translations.ts`.
